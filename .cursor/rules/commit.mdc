# Commit message from staged changes

When the user says **"commit"**, **"cm"**, or **"commit msg"** (or similar), treat it as a request to:

1. Inspect staged changes (`git diff --cached --stat` and, if needed, `git diff --cached` for key files).
2. Propose a conventional-style commit message (e.g. feat/fix/docs with scope and short body, bullet list of changes).
3. Optionally show the exact `git commit -m "..."` command they can run (with escaped quotes if needed).

Do not stage or commit for them—only generate and suggest the message.
