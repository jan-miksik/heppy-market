### Why These Defaults

- **guided autonomy**: Safer starting point than full auto, more interesting than strict rules
- **DeepSeek free**: Best reasoning-per-token among free OpenRouter models, supports structured output
- **1h interval**: Balances between too many LLM calls (cost/rate limits) and missing opportunities
- **20% max position**: Conservative enough to survive bad trades, large enough to be meaningful
- **5% stop loss / 10% take profit**: Classic 1:2 risk-reward ratio
- **3 pairs on Base**: WETH and cbBTC for stability, AERO for exposure to Base ecosystem native token
- **combined strategy**: LLM weighs all indicators — the whole point of using AI

### Free LLM Models Available on OpenRouter

| Model | Best For | Structured Output |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free` | Best reasoning, default choice | ✅ |
| `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free` | Good fallback, fast | ✅ |
| `mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:free` | Fast, lower quality | ✅ |
| `google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free` | Multimodal (chart images later?) | ✅ |
| `qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct:free` | Alternative reasoning | ✅ |

## Quick Start Commands for the Building Agent

### Claude Code
```bash
# In your empty project directory:
claude

# Then paste:
Read CLAUDE.md and build this project following the Build Order exactly.
After each phase, run the corresponding tests and show me the results.
Commit after each successful phase. Use conventional commits
(feat:, fix:, chore:). Start with Phase 1: Foundation.
Do not ask me questions — use the defaults in CLAUDE.md for all decisions.
If something fails, debug it yourself and retry up to 3 times before
asking me.
```

### Cursor
```
Open CLAUDE.md. This is the complete spec for the project.
Follow the Build Order section exactly, phase by phase.
After completing each phase, run the tests defined in the
Validation & Testing Strategy section.
Do not proceed to the next phase until tests pass.
Use all defaults specified in the document.
Start with Phase 1 now.
```
